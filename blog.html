			<h1>Advanced Internet Programming: Thoughts</h1>
      <p>Coming into Advanced Internet Programming, I had little experience with web development and absolutely no knowledge of frameworks. In the prior semester, I studied Programming on the Internet, it was a straight forward subject teaching the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Other than the jQuery library, it was pretty much vanilla JavaScript. The subject was taught in a traditional way, there were lectures which revealed more information about JavaScript and the following classes to put the knowledge into practice. Either way, I enjoyed learning about internet programming and decided to continue learning by picking the AIP subject. The structure of the subject was completely different to what I had expected. I thought that the subject would just be a more difficult version of POTI, with more advanced JavaScript functions and complex architectures. However what I experienced was an interactive, group based class which focuses on presentations, problem solving, critical thinking, design thinking and professional practices. In my opinion, I think this style of teaching is refreshing as opposed to the typical, individually driven and often boring programming tutorials. <br><br>

Each week, few members of the class are chosen to present a chosen topic about web development. It is very interesting to learn about the possibilities which the web is capable of, particularly the new innovative technologies such as virtual reality and different ways to create a website or application. It is somewhat overwhelming to keep up with how fast web technologies is growing they quickly surpass and replace current standards. Although it would be challenging to keep up with, I think that it would be rewarding career as it would encourage me to continuously learn and improve my workflow.<br><br>

The weekly portfolio opened up my perspective of learning, it allowed me to critically analyse what I’m learning and apply techniques to improve my work productivity. Each task forced me to learn or do work in a different way and each time I believe I have learnt something useful I can apply to future tasks. I liked how the main assignment allows us to choose our own stack and create our own idea for a website rather than create the exact same website and same way as everyone else. It is also the first time I’ve used GitHub, being a group assignment using GitHub made collaborating much smoother and more consistent. My last group programming assignment was problematic because we all completed our individual parts on our own but when we came together to integrate our work, everything broke. However with GitHub, we share the same files and every version pushed works. </p>
